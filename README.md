# Artflow Project (Dribbble Clone)

![Artflow Project](./public/images/1.png)

## Description

artflow Project is a dark version of Dribbble, a popular platform for designers to showcase their work. This project was built as a means for me to learn Next.js 13, a powerful React framework, and enhance my understanding of web development concepts through hands-on experience.

Building this project proved to be a rewarding challenge, especially when it came to working with GraphQL and Graphbase. By immersing myself in the development process, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of these technologies and solidify my knowledge.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 13:** A React framework that provides server-side rendering and other powerful features to build scalable web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allowed for rapid UI development and customization.
- **GraphQL with Graphbase:** Initially, the project utilized Graphbase for the database. However, I am planning to transition to Superbase to further improve the project's functionality and data management capabilities.

## Features

- Browse and explore a dark-themed interface for showcasing design work.
- Discover and engage with various design projects posted by users.
- Interact with the user community by liking, commenting, and sharing projects.
- Smooth navigation and intuitive user experience.
